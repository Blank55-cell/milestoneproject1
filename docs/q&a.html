     <p>Bathing is only needed when its neccessary a duration of once every 1-2 months or

  <summary class="button" aria-label="Expand to learn if dachshunds need professional grooming">Do i need to take my dachshund to the groomers?:</summary>
      <p>Wire haired dachshunds benefit the most from grooming a couple times a year but not too 
        often as it helps to keep them warm during the colder times of the year.
      Smooth haired dachshunds really require grooming and in turn only need to be brushed 
      Long haired dachshunds can be taken to the groomers as well but the main areas to focus on trimmming are the paws, ears and tail.

  <p>
    <ul>
      <!-- Fixed: spelling mistakes through out the <li> -->
      <h4>Starting early:</h4>
      <li>Starting early makes it significantly easier to train a puppy as they respond to commands more 
         quickly and aren't as temperamental as older dogs 
      </li>
      <h4>Keep it short and simple:</h4>
      <!-- Finished sentence-->
      <li>Around 5 to 10 minutes a day is more than enough to help train a dachshund puppy as they can become distracted or frustrated.</li>
      <h4>Be positive:</h4>
      <li>Any form of positive reinforcement can help a young 
        dachshund puppy to better understand the clear difference between good or bad actions</li>
       <h4>Be consistent</h4>
       <li>Ensuring that the training on hand follows through whether that training occurs once a day or two 
        times a week can help build a routine for the dog and owner ensuring that a clear bonding experience occurs
        making it more efficient for both parties.
