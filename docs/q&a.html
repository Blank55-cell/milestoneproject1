     <p>Most Frequently asked questions:</p>

    <details class="info">
      <summary class="button">What can I do to better care for my dog's coat?</summary> 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wire-haired:</strong> Benefit from professional grooming a few times a year.</li>
        <li><strong>Smooth-haired:</strong> Minimal grooming needed — brushing is usually enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-haired:</strong> Occasional trimming around paws, ears, and tail helps.</li>
      </ul>
       <p class="quick-tip">Quick tip dachshunds tend to be prone to skin issues due to their coats so brushing can help to spot any skin issues early.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="info">
      <summary class="button">How often should I bathe my dachshund?</summary>
       <p>Bathing is only needed when necessary — about once every 1-2 months or whenever dirty. Ensure that shampoo is specifically for your dog's type of hair to avoid drying out the skin or causing harm to their coat.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="info">
      <summary class="button">What should I feed my dachshund?</summary>
       <p>Balancing out the diet with omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids can help to support healthier skin and a shiny coat.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="info">
      <summary class="button">Do I need to take my dachshund to the groomers?</summary>
       <p>Wire-haired dachshunds benefit the most from grooming a couple of times a year but not too often, as it helps to keep them warm during colder times. Smooth haired dachshunds mainly require brushing. Long haired dachshunds can also be taken to the groomers, but trimming paws, ears, and tail is the main focus.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="info">
      <summary class="button">How often should my dachshund exercise?</summary>
       <p>Dachshunds need at most around 45 minutes to an hour per day, but it can vary depending on playtime at home. Be cautious with high intensity movement as it can affect their back.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="info">
      <summary class="button">How prone are dachshunds to separation anxiety?</summary>
       <p>Dachshunds bond very closely with their owners, making long separations difficult. With proper training they can cope better.</p>

     <summary class="button">Training tips for your dachshund</summary>
    <ul>
         <li><strong>Starting early:</strong> Training puppies is easier as they respond quickly and are less temperamental.</li>
         <li><strong>Keep it short and simple:</strong> 5-10 minutes a day is enough to avoid frustration or distraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Be positive:</strong> Use reinforcement so the puppy understands the difference between good and bad actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Regular training builds routine and strengthens the bond between dog and owner.</li>
    </ul>
