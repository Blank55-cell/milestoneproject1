<p>The main reason why The Sausage Den started in the first place was due to my own personal experience with trying to raise Mimi. She's 
  very closed off and shy towards new people, and thats something i've regretted not addressing at the very beginning of getting her and i wondered what 
  i could've done better in order to have avoided that from occuring. After 
  much thought, I decided to try and prevent any further issues that could occur, such as her developing back problems and determining
  how often she needs to exercise. Looking for a site that could offer more information on how to properly care for a dachshund puppy proved
  a bit difficult and ultimately led to me backtracking and trying to figure things out. Hence, I decided to create this site in order to help 
  others who may be in the same situation as me.
