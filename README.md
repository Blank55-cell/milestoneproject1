# milestone-project 1

## Main goal 

- The aim of the creation of this website is to create a source of information that can help dachshunds owners to better understand the aspects of dachsunds and how they behave and more importantly the potential ailments that they can develop. For example complicated back problems are the more prevenlant issues that can occur with the most dehabilitating one being IVDD (Interverterbate Disc Disease)that can occur further through their lives. Thia can lead to a costly and demoralising journey and for that reason i want to incorporate features that can allow for any daschund users to be able to enquire and better understand the potential risks of this disease and other ailments that can occur so that it can help reduce the potential risks of these issues occuring.

- In summary this website is being designed in order to better help dachshund owners understand  how to look after their dogs coats while explaining the potential health risks and care needs allowing for easier navigation, FAQs, and resources to help support a more responsible ownership.

             <br>
           <p>Smooth-coated Dachshunds have short, shiny fur that lies close to the body. 
            This is the most common coat type, requiring minimal grooming but offering little insulation in cold weather. 
            <strong>Negatives:</strong> They can feel the cold easily, may need sweaters in winter, and their sleek coat 
            shows scratches or skin issues more visibly.</p>

                 Long-haired Dachshunds feature soft, flowing fur with feathering on the ears, chest, and legs. 
                 They need regular brushing to prevent tangles and are known for their elegant appearance. 
                 <strong>Negatives:</strong> Their coat mats quickly if not maintained, they shed more, 
                 and grooming takes extra time and effort.

            <p> 
              Wire-haired Dachshunds have a dense, rough outer coat with bushy eyebrows and a beard. 
               Their scruffy look adds charm, but they require hand-stripping or trimming to maintain coat health. 
              <strong>Negatives:</strong> Grooming can be more specialized and costly, their coat feels rougher to
               touch, and they may be prone to itchiness if not properly maintained.</p>

- Solution: 
Using the embedded html line of code provided byb google maps allowed me to incorporate it.



## Changes done to the code/layout 
-  Changed the div columns from boot strap into my own in order to be more in control of the way they interact allowing for less breakages to occur. This has also made it less cluttered and cleaner.

- Changes done to the Q&A section changed from buttons to details helps to reduce the need for a load of css to be done and can help to organise the layout of the html into a much simpler order

# What can i do to better care for my dogs coat:
- Regular brushing can help out a lot in help to dislodge any hairs caught in the coat that may cause itching resulting non-stop scratching leading to patches appearing in the coat.
# Smooth haired:
- Smooth coats only need to be brushed once a week with a grooming mitt.
# Long haired: 
- 3-4 times a week with a more slicker brush can reduce any tangles in the coat and reduce the chances of any matting to occur.
# Wire haired:
- Weekly brushing should be more common as well the inclusion of trimming.
# Nutrition 
- Nutrition can help maintain their coat and help reduce the general chance of there being significant hair loss. 


# How often should i bathe my dachshund 
- Bathing is only needed when its neccessary a duration of once every 1-2 months or whenever dirty (ensure that a shampoo specifically for your dog is chosen, this avoids drying out the skin).  


# What should i feed my dachshund 
- Balancing out the diet with omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids can help to support a healthier skin and shiny coat.

# Do i need to take my dachshund to the groomers
- Wire haired dachshunds benefit the most from grooming a couple times a year but not too often as it helps to keep them warm during the colder times of the year.
- Smooth haired dachshunds really require grooming and in turn only need to be brushed 
- Long haired dachshunds can be taken to the groomers as well but the main areas to focus on trimmming are the paws, ears and tail.

# How much exercise should a dachshund need?
-Dachshunds need at most around 45minutes to an hour per day but it can vary dependingon the amount of playtime they have at home. Make sure to be wary of any high intensive movement as it can potentially affect their back.

# How prone are dachshunds to separation anxiety?
- Dachshunds are able to bond very closely to their owners making it hard for them to to be separated for long durations of time. With proper training the3y can cope better.
