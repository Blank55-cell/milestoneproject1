# milestone-project 1


The aim of the creation of this website is to create a source of information that can help dachshunds owners to better understand the aspects of dachsunds and how they behave and more importantly the potential ailments that they can develop. For example complicated back problems are the more prevenlant issues that can occur with the most dehabilitating one being IVDD (Interverterbate Disc Disease)that can occur further through their lives. Thia can lead to a costly and demoralising journey and for that reason i want to incorporate features that can allow for any daschund users to be able to enquire and better understand the potential risks of this disease and other ailments that can occur so that it can help reduce the potential risks of these issues occuring.
