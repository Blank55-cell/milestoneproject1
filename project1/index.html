<section class="section-box">


  <div class="div-box">
      <h2 class="sub-title">Smooth Coat:</h2>
       <img src="../assets/images/smoothhaired.jpg" alt="Smooth haired dachshund"  style="width:200px; border-radius:4px; margin-right:10px;">
       
             
           <p>Smooth-coated Dachshunds have short, shiny fur that lies close to the body. 
            This is the most common coat type, requiring minimal grooming but offering little insulation in cold weather. 
            <strong>Negatives:</strong> They can feel the cold easily, may need sweaters in winter, and their sleek coat 
            shows scratches or skin issues more visibly.</p>





  </div>


  <div class="div-box">


     <h2 class="sub-title">Long Haired Coat:</h2>
                <img src="../assets/images/longhaired.jpg" alt="Long haired dachshund" style="width:200px; border-radius:4px; margin-right:10px;">
                <br>
                <p>
                 Long-haired Dachshunds feature soft, flowing fur with feathering on the ears, chest, and legs. 
                 They need regular brushing to prevent tangles and are known for their elegant appearance. 
                 <strong>Negatives:</strong> Their coat mats quickly if not maintained, they shed more, 
                 and grooming takes extra time and effort.
                </p>







  </div>



  <div class="div-box">
    
      <h2 class="sub-title">Wire Haired Coat:</h2>
              <img src="../assets/images/wirehaired.jpg"  alt="Wire haired dachshund"  style="width:200px; border-radius:4px; margin-right:10px;">
              <br>
            <p> 
              Wire-haired Dachshunds have a dense, rough outer coat with bushy eyebrows and a beard. 
               Their scruffy look adds charm, but they require hand-stripping or trimming to maintain coat health. 
              <strong>Negatives:</strong> Grooming can be more specialized making them feel more uncomfortable and anxious due to the 
              high volume of dpgs that groomers get it may be quite costly, their coat feels rougher to
               touch, and they may be prone to itchiness if not properly maintained.</p>

    <section class="section-history">
      <h2>History of Dachshunds</h2>
      <p>Dachshunds originated in Germany over 300 years ago. They were bred to hunt small game such as badgers (their name literally translates to badger dog) which is the main reason why they love burrowing and have long bodies 
        perfect for being able to make their way through long burrows. They feature strong lungs and srong paws allowing them 
        to excavate and dig through layers of soil and dirt.
